# COMP4932_Assignment3_Nerual_Network

A demo video is included to demonstrate the functionality of the neural network.

How to use the neural net:
1. Using the inputs on the program, enter the number of hidden neurons,
   epochs, mini batch size, and the learning rate. For the video demo included,
   I used the following inputs:
   Hidden layers: 5
   Epochs: 1, you can increase this if you want but I would recommend 5 or less epochs
   because it takes a long time
   Mini batch size: 10
   Learning rate: 3.0
   
2. After entering all inputs, hit "Train" and it will train the network, this may take 
   a while based on the inputs you choose to enter, so you may use the inputs I 
   mentioned in the previous steps. When it's done there will be a message box 
   telling you what the best classification rate was out of all the epochs completed.
   
3. After the network is trained you can draw numbers in the box, and the network will predict
   what the number is by hitting "Predict", you can experiment with numbers drawn differently and 
   it may predict it correctly. You can clear your drawing area by hitting "Clear".
